# Enterprisey Sample Application[s]

## Setup Instructions

> [!NOTE]
> Node Version 20.x.x is recommended for this project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onehungrymind/enterprisey-apps.git
cd enterprisey-apps
npm install
npm start
```

There are four features (challenges, flashcards, notes, users) that will serve as remotes for the host application (dashboard).

To serve a feature, run the corresponding command.

```bash
npm run serve:challenges-feature
npm run serve:flashcards-feature
npm run serve:notes-feature
npm run serve:users-feature
```

The underlying NPM commands for a feature, are as follows.

```json
"serve:users-app": "npx nx serve users --open",
"serve:users-api": "npx nx serve users-api",
"serve:users-json": "json-server server/users.json --routes=server/routes.json --port=3400",
"serve:users-feature": "concurrently \"npm run serve:users-json\" \"npm run serve:users-app\""
```

We are currently serving the data for the feature from `json-server` but you could change the top-level command to use the Nest implementation if you wanted.

To run the dashboard, make sure the feature apps are up and running and then execute this command.

```
npx nx serve dashboard --open 
// or you can run which wraps the command above
npm start
```

## The Wizard

There is a tool that you can use to help accelerate development across features. It allows you to quickly pull code from one feature and generate an equivalent version for other features.

You can see the tool by running

```
npm run wizard
```

## The Portal

The portal is designed to allow for the registration of new remote applications to be loaded in the host application. 

```
npm run serve:portal-feature 
```

### Seeing It

**STEP ONE: Run the API**

```
npm run serve:portal-json 
```

**STEP TWO: Run the Remote Apps**

```
npm run serve:challenges-feature
npm run serve:flashcards-feature
npm run serve:notes-feature
npm run serve:users-feature
```

**STEP THREE: Run the Dashboard**

```
npm start
```

### Understanding It

In the dashboard app, we are able to load the remote defintions in the `main.ts` file like this.

```typescript
import { setRemoteDefinitions } from '@nx/angular/mf';

const FEATURES_API_URI = 'http://localhost:3000/api/features';

fetch(FEATURES_API_URI)
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((res) =>
    res.reduce((acc: any, r: any) => {
      acc[r.slug] = r.remote_uri;
      return acc;
    }, {})
  )
  .then((definitions: any) => setRemoteDefinitions(definitions))
  .then(() => import('./bootstrap').catch((err) => console.error(err)));
```

We are also dynamically defining our routes in the `app.component.ts` file in the dashboard. 

```typescript
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  features$: Observable<Feature[]> = this.featuresFacade.allFeatures$.pipe(
    tap((features: Feature[]) => this.configRoutes(features))
  );

  constructor(private featuresFacade: FeaturesFacade, private router: Router) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.featuresFacade.loadFeatures();
  }

  configRoutes(features: Feature[]) {
    const home: Route = {
      path: '',
      component: HomeComponent,
    };

    const routes = features.reduce((acc: any, cur: any) => {
      acc = [
        ...acc,
        {
          path: cur.slug,
          loadChildren: () =>
            loadRemoteModule(cur.slug, './Routes').then((m) => m.remoteRoutes),
        },
      ];
      return acc;
    }, [home]);

    this.router.resetConfig(routes);
  }
}
```

## Authentication

This feature uses the Users API to create and authenticate users. 

Start the service with `npm run s:users-api`.

Via curl, you can create a user like so:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:3400/api/users' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
"firstName": "test",
"lastName": "test last",
"email": "test@test.com",
"password": "test",
"role": "tester",
"company_id": "test"
}'
```

Once the user is created, you can log in like so:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3400/api/users/auth/login -d '{"email": "test@test.com", "password": "test"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

You will receive a token in the response. You can use this token to authenticate requests to the API.

## Docker 

**Build a Single Service**

To build a single service by passing the name to the build command.

```
npm run docker:build-remote <service name> (users, notes, flashcards, challenges)
```

**Build all the Services**

Run this command to build all the services. 

```
npm run docker:build-remote
```

NOTE: this will take a while, as it will build all the remote services in the monorepo.

**Run with docker-compose**

After building all the images, run the full stack with the following command.

```
npm run docker:run-remote
```

The service cluster will be available at `http://localhost:3500`; make API requests to the services at `http://localhost:3500/api/<service-name>`, the gateway will route the requests to the appropriate service.
